### My current supports and services

Everyone needs some level of support at different stages of their lives. My supports and their role in my life will change as I do, which is why it is important to review and manage my supports. There are many people in my current network who support me in a range of ways, they are listed below.

• Formal (paid) supports e.g. professionals such as ECEI partner, speech pathologist, childcare staff, GP. • Informal supports e.g. my immediate and extended family, friends, or neighbours. • Community supports e.g. playgroup coordinator, swimming teacher, local library staff.
